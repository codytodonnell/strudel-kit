STRUDEL Kit is a web development toolkit for building scientific UIs based on the STRUDEL Design System and Task Flows. The toolkit helps users build out scientific Task Flows as usable web applications. It consists of a suite of React-based TypeScript templates and a command line interface for bootstrapping apps using the templates. Apps built with STRUDEL are pre-baked with much of the setup you need to turn complex Task Flows into efficient and highly usable experiences for your users.","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"task-flows/compare-data":{"id":"task-flows/compare-data","title":"Compare Data","description":"Links","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"task-flows/contribute-data":{"id":"task-flows/contribute-data","title":"Contribute Data","description":"Links","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"task-flows/explore-data":{"id":"task-flows/explore-data","title":"Explore Data","description":"Links","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"task-flows/monitor-activities":{"id":"task-flows/monitor-activities","title":"Monitor Activities","description":"Links","sidebar":"mainSidebar"},"task-flows/overview":{"id":"task-flows/overview","title":"Overview","description":"Task Flow templates in STRUDEL Kit are UI flows built out as React components that plug directly into your base app. They are based on the Task Flows in the STRUDEL Design System which offer user-friendly methods for implementing common patterns seen in scientific and data-intensive UIs.
